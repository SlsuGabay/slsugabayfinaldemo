        <h1>About <br>SLSU GABAY</h1><br>
        <p>Welcome to SLSU GABAY: <b>G</b>uide <b>A</b>nd <b>B</b>ridge for <b>A</b>ccessing <b>Y</b>our-way, your comprehensive mobile navigation companion designed
            specifically for the Southern Luzon State University - Main Campus.
            This application is the culmination of a dedicated thesis project,
            created to simplify and enhance the campus experience for students, faculty,
            and visitors alike. Navigating a large campus can be challenging, and
            SLSU Gabay aims to eliminate the stress of finding classrooms, offices, and
            other essential locations.</p><br>

        <h2>The Creators and Their Vision</h2>
        <p>SLSU GABAY was developed by Cristina Amor L. Buera and Mark Gabrielle A. Quicay,
            fourth-year students from the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology,
            majoring in Computer Technology, at the College of Industrial Technology.
            This project is the result of our passion for leveraging technology to solve
            real-world problems within our university community. We envisioned a user-friendly
            tool that would empower everyone to move around the campus with ease and confidence.</p><br>

        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>This mobile navigation application is the primary output of our research, titled
            "A Mobile Navigation Application for Southern Luzon State University - Main Campus."
            Our research and development process involved meticulous data gathering, user testing,
            and interactive design to ensure the application meets the specific needs of the SLSU.
            We focused on creating an intuitive interface and accurate mapping system,
            making SLSU GABAY an indispensable tool for campus navigation.</p><br>

        <h2>Our Commitment and Future Development</h2>
        <p>We are committed to continuously improving SLSU Gabay to meet the evolving needs of the SLSU
            community. We welcome feedback and suggestions to enhance the application's functionality
            and user experience. As we move forward, we plan to incorporate updates and new features
            to ensure SLSU Gabay remains a valuable resource for everyone on campus.</p><br>

        <p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our thesis advisors: Dr. Ricaryl Catherine P. Cruz and Dr. Arvin N. Natividad, faculty members, and fellow students for their support and guidance throughout this project.
            <br><br>For any inquiries or feedback, please contact us at: Cristina Buera â€“ <a href="mailto: buera.cristinaamor@gmail.com">buera.cristinaamor@gmail.com </a> or Mark Quicay - <a href="mailto: quicay.markgabrielle@gmail.com">quicay.markgabrielle@gmail.com</a>
